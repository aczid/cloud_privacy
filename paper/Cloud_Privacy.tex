\section{Introduction}
In recent years there has been a lot of positive buzz surrounding the idea of \textit{cloud computing}: a systems design trend that allows applications to run as ubiquitous services by providing abstractions to the lower layers of application architecture.
These layers can be distinguished as \textit{Software}, \textit{Platform} and \textit{Infrastructure} and each of these has a different target audience which can buy these facilities ``as a service'', i.e., Software/Platform/Infrastructure as a Service (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS). 
Such abstractions bring benefits like implicit redundancy, centralized security measures and, most importantly, reduces capital and operational expenses for customers by the increased efficiency at which each layer can be managed.

That being said, there is also a note of concern with things like centralized information management, giving up physical segregation for logical segregation, near-infinite storage capacity, cheap, ubiquitous computing power and the legal issues surrounding information processing systems whose infrastructure scale transcends national borders.

In cloud computing it's apparent that there is a very strong connection between security and privacy.
If any central component of cloud infrastructure were to be compromised it could almost certainly be used to disclose very privacy-sensitive information, given the scale of cloud infrastructure providers and what kind of private information is (or can be) recorded using applications running ``in the cloud''. In fact, there is no proof or technically feasible way to prove that such a compromise hasn't occurred.

In this paper we will go over some of the potential and actual privacy-related problems we have encountered as part of our study on the technical and legal domains of cloud computing. Starting off, in \autoref{sec:problems_in_cloud_computing} we shall give a fairly broad overview of the issues involved with cloud computing.
This will lead into an analysis of the current legal situation regarding cloud computing in \autoref{sec:legal_analysis}. In \autoref{sec:pet} and \autoref{sec:technical_analysis} we will go over the technical situation, specifically describing some of the solutions to privacy-related problems in cloud computing by means of Privacy Enhancing Techologies (PETs).

\section{Problems in cloud computing}
\label{sec:problems_in_cloud_computing}
General concerns with cloud security: centralisation, single point of failure, corporate espionage, subpoenas to the provider, impact of security compromises
\cite{chow2009controlling}

We want to cover either of these two cases:

\section{Legal analysis}
\label{sec:legal_analysis}

In this section we will review the relevant legal aspects surrounding cloud computing. We shall focus on the European legal framework since it is the most extensive.

\subsection{Legal setting}
The key legislature is the EU Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC, which provides basic rights to consumers' data by obligating data collectors to uphold their right to privacy. \cite{directive199595}
This directive is based on seven key principles surrounding citizen privacy.
They are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Data subjects should be given notice of collection;
\item Data should only be used for the purposes specified;
\item Data should not be disclosed without the subject's consent;
\item The data processors should uphold adequate security;
\item It should be disclosed to data subjects who is processing their information;
\item Data subjects should be allowed to access and update their data;
\item It should be possible to hold data collectors accountable to these principles.
\end{itemize}

This legislature is set to be succeeded by the General Data Protection Regulation, which amends the code to extend its reach beyond the EU, and applies everywhere information about EU citizens is collected.
It also mandates that data breaches must be reported to the Data Protection Authority, and stipulates serious fines for failure to comply.
Note, however, that this regulation is still under review and thus subject to change.


Complementary to the Data Protection Directive is the E-privacy Directive (Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications), which also protects citizens from excessive data retention, spam e-mail and the use of tracking cookies without explicit consent.
This document spawned the much-debated ``Cookie law'' (Cookiewet) in the Netherlands.

In a cloud computing setting, the main legal problems boil down to two issues: accountability of non-EU companies and multi-tenancy of cloud applications.
% Explain

% Auditing standards and the fact that no practical baseline audit standards are mandated by relevant law

As a side note, the United States Department of Commerce has worked with the EU to develop the Data Protection Directive principles into what they call ``Safe Harbor'' principles which US companies can opt-in to.
This essentially allowed US companies to do business with the EU, which has the more stringent data protection legislation.
Also, the Digital Millenium Copyright Act (DMCA) recognizes the concept of a ``mere conduit'' (of information) as did the European Data Protection Directive. \cite{congress1998digital}
